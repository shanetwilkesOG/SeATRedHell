# SeAT Docker Compose Configuration

# Web server configuration.
# SeAT running in a docker-compose setup ships with Traefik
# as the default web server. You only need to configure the
# parent domain and port where the web server will listen.
# In most cases, just configuring the domain will be all
# you need to do.
#
# For advanced users, if the default httpchallenge is not what
# you wanted, refer to the Traefik 2 docs here:
#   https://docs.traefik.io/https/acme/#the-different-acme-challenges

TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=RedHell
TRAEFIK_HTTPS_PORT=443
# Only used for ACME, SeAT won't listen here.
TRAEFIK_HTTP_PORT=80

# Web server TLS.
#
# One of the amazing features of Traefik is easy-mode TLS config
# toegether with Let's Encrypt. Simply Enable autmatic certificate
# renewals by uncommenting the cert resolver lines in the seat-web
# service and enter your email address below (ACME requirement).

TRAEFIK_ACME_EMAIL=shanetwilkes@gmail.com

# SeAT Web Address
#
# Taking into consideration the value you set for TRAEFIK_DOMAIN,
# the SEAT_SUBDOMAIN value is the DNS hostname configuration for
# the SeAT User Interface. Setting this to a value of `seat`, with
# TRAEFIK_DOMAIN set as `seat.local` means your installations web
# interface will be available at `seat.seat.local`.

SEAT_SUBDOMAIN=SeAT

# Eve Online SSO Configuration.
#
# This is a *required* setup step. Refer to the docs to learn how
# to get the correct values to enter here.
